# XS-SERPENT
Cross-section generator with Serpent
-------------------------------------

The project focuses on developing a wrapper for Serpent that will generate homogenized few-group cross sections with Serpent. 
The following features should be included:
1) Parallelism 
2) Full branches
2.1) Fuel temperature
2.2) Coolant temperature and density separately  
2.3) Burnup
2.4) Power
2.5) Control rods (by switching materials)
2.6) Xenon
2.7) Boron 
3) Macroscopic and microscopic cross-sections
4) History branches (different nominal conditions)
5) Discontinuity factors (axial and radial)

6) Various output formats (DYN3D, PARCS, OpenFoam, etc.)
